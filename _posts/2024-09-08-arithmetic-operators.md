Arithmetic operators

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Mod (the remainder after dividing)
** Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
// Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer
The usual order of mathematical operations holds in Python, which you can review in this Math Forum page(opens in a new tab) if needed.

Bitwise operators are special operators in Python that you can learn more about [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) if you'd like.


<b>Examples

1. print(3 + 5) # 8
2. print(1 + 2 + 3 * 3) # 12
